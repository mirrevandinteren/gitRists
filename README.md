# gitRists

This is the Github repository for team Git.Rists for the lab-course UCACCMET2J.
We used this repo to quickly share files with our teammembers and to access previous versions of our scripts.

In this repository you will find scripts both in Python and in R. 
The Python scripts are used for data processing while the R scripts are used to visualise the data.

The data used in this research is the 'People of Wikipedia' dataset.


~ Sincerely,
Mirre, Siem, Blanka, and Kate
